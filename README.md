# Tic-Tac-Toe Codex Sample

This repository contains a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this sample is to demonstrate how you can use OpenAI Codex (via ChatGPT Plus) to interact with, understand, and extend a real codebase.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-codex-sample.git
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in a browser** to play the game.
3. **Use Codex:** Within ChatGPT Plus, ask Codex to add features or refactor code, for example:
   - "Add a scoring system that keeps track of wins for X and O."
   - "Refactor the JavaScript code to use modules."
   - "Make the game board responsive and animate the winning line."

Feel free to experiment by requesting changes, new features, or optimizations via Codex.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing game markup.
- `style.css`: Styling for the game board and UI.
- `game.js`: Game logic and interaction handlers.
- `.gitignore`: Basic ignores for common OS files.
